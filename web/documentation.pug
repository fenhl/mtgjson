      h2 Booster Field
      p
        | The 'booster' key is present for each set that has physical boosters (so not present for box sets, duel decks, digital masters editions, etc.). It is an array containing one item per card in the booster. Thus the array length is how many cards are in a booster. Each item in the array is either a string representing the type of booster card or an array of strings representing possible types for that booster card.
      p
        | For example, 'Magic 2013' contains 1 land, 1 marketing card, 10 commons, 3 uncommons and 1 rare or mythic rare:
      pre
        code(data-language="javascript").
          {
            "name" : "Magic 2013",
            "booster" : [ "land", "marketing", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "uncommon", "uncommon", "uncommon", [ "rare", "mythic rare" ] ]
          }
      p The common booster card types are:
      ul
        li common
        li uncommon
        li rare
        li mythic rare
        li land
        li marketing
        li checklist
        li double faced
      p The Time Spiral block has some additional types:
      ul
        li timeshifted common
        li timeshifted uncommon
        li timeshifted rare
        li timeshifted purple
      p
        | Note that the 'Time Spiral "Timeshifted"' set does not have a booster field. This 'set' was actually a subset of the 'Time Spiral' set and its cards are the 'timeshifted purple' booster card type mentioned above.
        | The "Magic: The Gathering—Conspiracy" expansion has an additional "draft-matters" type which can either be a "Conspiracy" type card or a card that affects drafting.
        | The "Vintage Masters" set has one slot that can contain either a power nine card or a guaranteed foil, so it has additional types "power nine" and "foil".
        | Foils are not explictily mentioned, except for 'Modern Masters' where a slot is guaranteed a foil. So that set has four additional possible booster card types: foil common, foil uncommon, foil rare and foil mythic rare.
        | Any card marked as "starter" : true should be exempted from any booster generation as these cards were only available in boxed sets and not in boosters.

        | If a value would be empty (such as manaCost for Basic Lands), then the key will not exist in the object.
        | All cards are from the latest Oracle text, not the original printed text (the 'extras' file has the originalText which is the non-oracle text).

      h2 JSONP
      p
        | All JSON files are also available as JSONP files by changing the extension from '.json' to '.jsonp'.
        | This allows you to include them client side by linking to them directly with a <script> tag.
      p
        | HTML Example: <script type="text/javascript" src="http://mtgjson.com/json/AllSets.jsonp"></script>
      p
        | A callback handler called 'mtgjsoncallback' will be called with 2 arguments.
        | The first argument is the JSON data itself. This isn't a string, so no need to call JSON.parse()
        | The second is the file name as a string, without an extension ("AllSets" in the example).
      p Client side javascript example:
      pre
        code(data-language="javascript").
          window.mtgjsoncallback = function(data, name) {
            /* handling code here */
          };
